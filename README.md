Note!!: When migrating this pipeline to environments with a Sun Grid Engine scheduler, make sure to alter the first five lines of the workflow script to make it compatible!!  
Two folders will be generated called **End-User-Results** and **Supporting-Files**. The End-User-Results folder will contain files that are fed into 16S_Sequencing_QC_v6.0.3.R. The Supporting-Files contains everything in the End-User-Results folder, as well as the intermediate product files.

### 16S_Sequencing_QC_v6.0.3.R
Please ensure the **16S_Sequencing_QC_16SAcceptedSpecies.txt** from the `database_files` folder is in the same working directory as **16S_Sequencing_QC_v6.0.3.R**. The 16S_Sequencing_QC_16SAcceptedSpecies.txt contains species that were specifically trained to be accruately classified by the Na√Øve Bayesian Classifier.  
After running the **dada2_pipeline_vP_v11_cleaned.sh** pipeline, several dada2 output files will be generated which are fed into the **16S_Sequencing_QC_v6.0.3.R** to generate read counts and ASVs.

## Dada2 Pipeline Processing Description

### Data transfer to the cluster and check MD5 codes (perform manually):
Copy files to a common location (when you need to transfer compressed FASTQ files (.gz) from the MiSeq to your computer system).
```
cp **/*.gz raw_reads_directory
```
Example of the demultiplexed file naming format:  
B123-GWU-DNA_325_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz (contains suffix with R1 or R2 to designate forward and reverse for pair-end reads).


### Create input folders (performed by pipeline):
Our pipeline creates two directories for storing trimmed and primer-free reads and a folder for storing all the output data.


### Quality trim raw data (performed by pipeline):
We run Trimmomatic to trim and remove low quality sequences from our raw data.
```
perl $scripts/run_trimmomatic_amplicon_mode.pl $input_folder/*

	Selected settings (inside Perl script):
  	--leading 3		Remove leading low quality or 3 bases	
  	--trailing 3		Remove trailing low quality or 3 bases
  	--slidingwindow 4:15	Scan the read with a 4-base wide sliding window, trimming when the average quality per base drops below 15
  	--minlen 225		Drop the read if it is below 225 bp (for V3-V4 regions)
```


### Pre-processing raw data (performed by pipeline):
DADA2 infers error models from reads and will generate inaccurate data if primer sequences are included, so we first need to remove them. We use Cutadapt 2.1 on each FASTQ file pair (forward and reverse) with GNU parallel.
```
cutadapt --pair-filter any --no-indels -e 0.15 --discard-untrimmed -g file:${primer_path} -G file:${primer_path} -Z -o primer_trimmed_reads/${f1}.gz -p primer_trimmed_reads/${f2}.gz ${1} ${2} > primer_trimmed_reads/${f1%%.fastq*}_cutadapt_log.txt

export -f remove_adapter;

parallel --link --jobs $threads remove_adapter ::: trimmed_reads/*_R1_*.fastq ::: trimmed_reads/*_R2_*.fastq
```
file:amplicon_primers_f.fasta or file:amplicon_primers_r.fasta ‚Äì make sure the file contains only the primers you have used for sequencing. 

Then filter out reads with ambigious base calls (Ns)
```
$scripts/dada2_filter.R -f primer_trimmed_reads --maxN 0 --truncQ 0 --threads $threads --truncLen 0 --maxEE 2,2 --f_match _R1_.*fastq.gz --r_match _R2_.*fastq.gz -o $my_output/${run_name}_filtered_fastqs
```


### DADA2 inference (performed by pipeline):
Merge clean paired-end reads and subsequently infer error models from the reads and identify Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). 
```
$scripts/dada2_inference.R -f $my_output/${run_name}_filtered_fastqs/ --seed 4124 -t $threads --verbose --plot_errors --minOverlap 12 -o $my_output/${run_name}_seqtab.rds
```


### DADA2 chimera checking and taxonomy assignment (performed by pipeline): 
Remove chimeric variants and assign taxonomy to each non-chimeric variant. The dada2 package implements a method to make species level assignments based on exact matching between ASVs and sequenced reference strains. Recent analysis suggests that exact matching (or 100% identity) is the only appropriate way to assign species to 16S gene fragments. 
```
$scripts/dada2_chimera_taxa.R -i $my_output/${run_name}_seqtab.rds -t 2 -r $database/$db_taxonomy -s $database/$db_species --allowMultiple --minBoot 80 --count_out $my_output/${run_name}_seqtab_final.rds --sp_out $my_output/${run_name}_species_final.rds --tax_out $my_output/${run_name}_tax_final.rds
```


### Convert DADA2 R objects to BIOM and FASTA (performed by pipeline):
Convert RDS object to a variant count table (BIOM) and variant sequence file (FASTA).  
```
$scripts/convert_dada2_out.R -i $my_output/${run_name}_seqtab_final.rds -b $my_output/${run_name}_biom.tsv -f $my_output/${run_name}_species.fasta --taxa_in $my_output/${run_name}_species_final.rds --taxa_out $my_output/${run_name}_taxa_metadata.txt
```


### Convert BIOM TSV format to JSON and create summary (performed by pipeline):
JSON is an efficient and commonly used data format for storing bacterial count data. HDF5 is another format, however ColonialOne does not handle it well. 

```
biom convert -i $my_output/${run_name}_biom.tsv -o $my_output/${run_name}_json.biom --to-json

biom summarize-table -i $my_output/${run_name}_json.biom -o $my_output/${run_name}_json_summary.txt
```


### Classify variant sequences in FASTA file using RDP Classifier (performed by pipeline):
Assign taxonomy to all variants (second time) using RDP classification. The pipeline classifies bacterial lineages until the genus level, and performs a species level assignment using a custom classifier, called V6species.
```
# Genus level classification
java -Xmx12g -jar $rdp/classifier.jar classify -o $my_output/RDP212_GENUS_taxa_metadata.txt -q $my_output/${run_name}_species.fasta -f fixrank

# Species level classification using a custom classifier
java -Xmx12g -jar $rdp/classifier.jar classify -o $my_output/RDP212_V6species_taxa_metadata.txt -q $my_output/${run_name}_species.fasta -t $v6species/rRNAClassifier.properties
```


### Add RDP taxonomy labels to BIOM files (performed by pipeline):
Add taxonomy labels to the BIOM files. We add the V6species and default RDP taxonomy labels to separate BIOM tables. 
```
biom add-metadata -i $my_output/${run_name}_json.biom -o $my_output/${run_name}_RDP212_GENUS_c80_tax.biom --observation-metadata-fp $my_output/RDP212_GENUS_taxa_metadata.txt.c80_BIOMversion.tsv --observation-header OTUID,taxonomy --sc-separated taxonomy --output-as-json

biom add-metadata -i $my_output/${run_name}_json.biom -o $my_output/${run_name}_RDP212_V6-SPECIES_c80_tax.biom --observation-metadata-fp $my_output/RDP212_V6species_taxa_metadata.txt.c80_BIOMversion.tsv --observation-header OTUID,taxonomy --sc-separated taxonomy --output-as-json
```


### Summarize taxa and store results in new tables (performed by pipeline):
Provide summary information of the representation of taxonomic groups within each sample. The taxonomic level for which the summary information is provided is designated with -L option (L2 = Phylum, L7 = Species). Please be aware that this step removes the ‚Äòstrain‚Äô level information associated with ASVs. For instance, if a sample contains five S. aureus ASVs, the count data for those variants will be merged/summed (in the L7 file). Those five variants will be merged with other Staph species in the L6 file to give one count value per sample etc. 
```
summarize_taxa.py -i $my_output/${run_name}_RDP212_GENUS_c80_tax.biom -L 2,3,4,5,6 -o $my_output/${run_name}_RDP212_GENUS_c80_tax_summarizeTaxa --absolute_abundance

summarize_taxa.py -i $my_output/${run_name}_RDP212_V6-SPECIES_c80_tax.biom -L 2,3,4,5,6,7 -o $my_output/${run_name}_RDP212_V6-SPECIES_c80_tax_summarizeTaxa --absolute_abundance
```


### 16S_Sequencing_QC_v6.0.3.R
After filling in the USER INPUTS section and running the script using the files generated by dada2 pipeline, the script will output several compiled files that can be further processed in R for analysis.
	* _Groups.xlsx -- Aggregate the read counts at the taxonomic levels from Phylum to Family.
	* _mainData.xlsx -- Primary excel that contains Genus and Species level read counts, along with presence and proportions.
	* _QC.xlsx -- Filters out samples identified as NEC and PEC samples for QC checking, along with samples with less than the cutoff (default is 1000).
	* _taxaData.csv -- Read counts with ASV seq_ID as rows. Utilized after blasting and identifying ASV seq_id species.
	* _ASV.xlsx -- Excel tabs compiles ASV seq_IDs that are labeled as the taxas of interest (specified in User Inputs).
